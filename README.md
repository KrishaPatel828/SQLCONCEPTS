# SQL Practice Repository

Welcome to my SQL Practice Repository! This collection of SQL exercises focuses on essential concepts and skills for data analysis using SQL. The purpose of this repository is to reinforce my understanding of SQL through practice exercises and projects.

### Contents

This repository is organized into different folders based on SQL topics:

1. **Basic SQL Commands**
   - Practice foundational SQL commands like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY`.
   - Exercises focus on filtering data, sorting, and retrieving specific subsets of data.

2. **Joins**
   - Practice with different types of joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
   - Examples demonstrate combining data from multiple tables and understanding relationships between datasets.

3. **Aggregate Functions**
   - Use aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to perform calculations on data.
   - Exercises cover grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering grouped results using `HAVING`.

4. **Subqueries and Nested Queries**
   - Practice writing subqueries and nested queries to extract data based on dynamic conditions.
   - Examples focus on using subqueries in `WHERE` and `FROM` clauses to retrieve targeted information.

5. **Case Statements**
   - Use `CASE` statements to introduce conditional logic into queries.
   - Scenarios include categorizing and labeling data based on specific criteria.

6. **Data Cleaning**
   - SQL techniques for identifying and cleaning messy or inconsistent data.
   - Topics include handling `NULL` values, using `COALESCE`, and removing duplicate entries.

7. **Window Functions**
   - Examples of window functions like `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, and `DENSE_RANK`.
   - Exercises include partitioning data and applying analytical functions for more advanced data insights.

8. **Creating and Modifying Tables**
   - Practice with `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` commands to set up and modify database structures.
   - Exercises include creating tables, altering table structures, and specifying data types.

### Getting Started

Each folder contains practice queries with comments explaining the logic and purpose behind each example. Feel free to explore the different topics to see how each SQL concept is applied.

### About This Project

This repository serves as a record of my SQL learning journey, providing a foundation in data manipulation and analysis using SQL. Each exercise builds upon fundamental SQL skills essential for working with databases in data analysis.

### Future Plans

I plan to continue expanding this repository as I progress, adding new topics and more complex exercises. My aim is to build a well-rounded portfolio of SQL skills that demonstrates my understanding and capability in data analysis.
